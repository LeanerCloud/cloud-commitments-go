// Package purchasecfg provides a tightened AWS SDK config for purchase-path
// clients.
//
// Background: the AWS SDK v2 default retry policy (3 attempts, up to 30s per
// request) can consume up to ~90s wall-clock time when an API is slow. That
// budget exceeds the Lambda function timeout (previously 60s, now bumped to
// 300s). Purchase-path calls do not benefit from many retries because the
// errors that triggered this fix (context deadline exceeded) are caused by the
// Lambda budget itself running out -- retrying inside the same Lambda makes
// the situation worse, not better.
//
// Recommendation-collection clients deliberately keep the SDK default config;
// they call Cost Explorer and can tolerate more retries legitimately.
