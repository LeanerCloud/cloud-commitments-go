// expiring share as already-uncovered and recommend replacements.

// adjusted, so the caller can log a meaningful summary.

// No-op when windowDays <= 0 or commitments is empty. The intent is that

// callers gate the invocation on cfg.RebuyWindowDays.

// adjustment lines up with the data ApplyCoverageMapToRecommendations
// just populated. Commitments whose pool key doesn't match any rec are
// silently dropped (they're for instance types we're not currently
// recommending; nothing to subtract from).
