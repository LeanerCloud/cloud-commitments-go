// Used by ApplyFamilyNUSizingRDS to translate AWS-rec-API's family-NU-
// bundled buy recommendations into the family target NU need under
// --target-coverage. Sizes not in this map evaluate to 0 NU. Recs
// with an empty family prefix (unknown size suffix) are routed to
// nonRDS by partitionRDSRecsByFamily and handled by the per-pool path.
// Recs with a known family prefix but an unrecognized size suffix reach
// sizeRDSFamilyRecs with 0 NU; if the whole family sums to zero
// (currentNU <= 0) they are recorded in drops.NoNUSignal and dropped.

//     b. gap = targetPct − existing_pct (drop family if ≤ 0)
//     c. target_NU_need = gap / 100 * total_NU
//     d. current_rec_NU = Σ rec.Count × NU(rec.size)
//     e. scale = target_NU_need / current_rec_NU
//     f. Apply scale to each rec.Count and cost-bearing fields
//  3. Recs scaled to zero are dropped (size flex left no room).
