// the group, so one subscription failing (e.g. the principal lost Reader
// access mid-run, or a subscription-specific throttle) never cancels
// sibling subscriptions. The semaphore that bounds aggregate concurrent ARM
// calls is acquired inside each per-subscription client's own
// GetRecommendations (around the outbound API calls, not around this
// fan-out), so no additional semaphore is needed at this layer.
//
// After g.Wait(), ctx.Err() is checked explicitly: g.Wait() only reports
// errors returned to the group, and every goroutine here returns nil, so a
// parent-context cancellation would otherwise go unnoticed.
//
// If every subscription fails, GetRecommendations returns a wrapped error
// instead of a silently empty, nil-error result -- the same
// all-attempted-failed guard used by mergeServiceResults, ported here so a
// total credential/throttle failure isn't indistinguishable from "no
// savings available across the whole tenant".
//
// If SOME subscriptions fail, it returns the successful subscriptions'
// recommendations together with a *PartialSubscriptionFailureError. Callers
// that want the partial data must inspect the error with errors.As; a caller
// that treats any non-nil error as fatal gets a loud failure rather than a
// silently incomplete sweep. Either way the incompleteness is visible in the
// return values, not just in a log line.

// subscription: they are reported as ErrSubscriptionNotAccessible failures
// rather than silently dropped from the sweep, so a partially-satisfied filter

// subset of accounts must not be handed another account's data by the Azure
// path either. Before org-wide fan-out existed this was moot -- a
// subscription-scoped client could only ever return its own subscription --
// but a client covering every visible subscription has to honour the filter
// or it silently widens the caller's scope.
//
// Filtering BEFORE the fan-out (rather than discarding rows afterwards, as
// AWS does) also avoids issuing ARM calls against subscriptions the caller
// never asked about.
//
// An empty filter means "every visible subscription" -- the org-wide default
// this client exists to provide. A non-empty filter that matches nothing is
// an error rather than an empty result: returning zero recommendations would
// be indistinguishable from "these subscriptions have no savings available".
//
// A filter that matches SOME of its entries and misses others is the same
// hazard at smaller scale, so the misses are reported too, via the second
// return value: an operator who scopes a sweep to sub-A and sub-B, and whose
// principal has since lost Reader on sub-B, must not be handed sub-A's
// recommendations with a nil error -- sub-B would read as "no savings
// available" rather than "never queried". The misses are folded into the
// partial-failure error by mergeSubscriptionResults rather than failing the
// call outright, because a stored filter covering many subscriptions must not
// become a total collection outage the moment one of them is deleted or
// access to it is revoked. That is the same trade-off
